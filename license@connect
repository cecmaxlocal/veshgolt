The license activation process for Safe Software FME products involves these steps:

- For a single-fixed license, open the FME Licensing Assistant (found in the Start menu or installation folder) and select "Activate a single-fixed license." Enter your serial number from the purchase confirmation email, and click Activate. A confirmation message will appear upon successful activation. This license ties to your system's hardware, so changing hardware may require reactivation.[1][2]

- If automated activation fails, you can manually install a license file (*.fmelic) downloaded from Safeâ€™s license activation web page by providing your serial number and registration key from the Licensing Assistant. The manual license is entered into the Licensing Assistant to complete activation.[3][4][5]

- For floating licenses, a floating license server must be installed and configured, from which client machines request licenses dynamically based on availability.[10][1]

- The registration key is a unique identifier generated from your system hardware by the Licensing Assistant, used to create and limit licenses to specific machines.[4]

- If you encounter issues, license activation can also be assisted via email communication with Safe Software support including serial number and registration key to receive license files.[3][4]

In short, Safe Software licenses activate through an automated or manual process using the FME Licensing Assistant, linking licenses to physical hardware or to a floating license server, ensuring compliance and allowing flexibility in deployment.[1][4][10][3]
