A "matrix" in software licensing typically refers to a comparison chart or table outlining the different license options, features, and configurations available for a product. In the context of Safe Software FME, this matrix would include details on license types like fixed (node-locked), floating, subscription, and enterprise licenses, along with their features, limitations, and suitable use cases.

- Fixed licenses are tied to a specific machine, ideal for single-user setups, whereas floating licenses are shared across multiple users via a license server, supporting organizational environments.[1]

- Subscription licenses provide access for a defined period and often include updates and support, while perpetual licenses are purchased outright with optional annual maintenance.[2]

- Safe Software offers different licensing variants tailored to industries, deployment sizes, and use cases, with a clear comparison of features and costs.[3]

- License management involves features like license borrowing, server redundancy, and version compatibility, which are also part of the licensing matrix.[8][10]

While there isn't a publicly downloadable "license matrix" document, these details are summarized in the official documentation and product comparison pages, helping users select the best license configuration for their needs.[1][2][3]
